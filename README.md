# Gatsby RTL blog starter with Strapi CMS

This is a highly customized rtl starter:

- Includes Strapi as a CMS. Connected to the Strapi server hosted in Heroku.

- Pages auto generated from server. Including blogs pages `blog/**/title` and
  internal pages `pages/title`.

- Templates for the blog, feed, page, and 404.

- A very component-based to increase your work productivity and make it for
  customization.

- Has SEO runs for each page in the site. With google verification and
  analytics meta links.

- SVG Social icons (not all included in the header).

- ESlint config with Prettier.

> Samples are written in Arabic but the starter works for any rtl languages
> including Hebrew.

## Know limitations

- It's not responsive.

- Despite it has all plugins to read local content, I don't think there's a need
  to aut generate pages form local based content since it already has Strapi.
